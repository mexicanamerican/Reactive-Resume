description: "Learn how to move resume items from one section to another, or to a different page, to better organize your content and split lengthy sections across multiple pages."
---

If you have a long work history or extensive project list, you may want to split items across multiple pages or reorganize them into different sections. The **Move to** feature lets you do exactly that—quickly relocate any item to another section or page with just a few clicks.

## Why move items?

- **Split lengthy sections**: If your Experience section spans more than one page, you can move older roles to a custom section on page 2.
- **Reorganize content**: Move a project from "Projects" to a custom "Open Source" section, or relocate a skill to a different grouping.
- **Fine-tune page layout**: Control exactly which items appear on which page for a polished, balanced resume.

## How to move an item

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the resume builder">
    Navigate to your resume and open it in the builder.

    <Info>
      Make sure you have at least one item in a section (e.g., an experience entry, project, or skill) before proceeding.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Locate the item you want to move">
    In the left sidebar, find the section containing the item you want to relocate. Click on the section to expand it and view all items.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the item dropdown menu">
    Each item has a **dropdown menu** (three-dot icon or chevron) on the right side. Click this icon to reveal the available actions.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Hover over 'Move to'">
    In the dropdown menu, hover over or click the <Badge>Move to</Badge> option. This will open a submenu showing all available destinations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a destination">
    The submenu displays available destinations organized by:

    - **Existing sections** of the same type (e.g., other Experience sections)
    - **Pages** where you can place the item
    - **Custom sections** if any exist

    Click on your desired destination to move the item there.

    </Frame>
    
    <Tip>
      If a custom section of the same type doesn't exist on your target page, Reactive Resume will **automatically create one** for you. This makes it easy to split sections across pages without manual setup.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the move">
    After selecting a destination, the item will be moved immediately. You can verify by:

    - Checking the destination section in the left sidebar
    - Looking at the resume preview to see where the item now appears

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Splitting Work Experience across pages

A common use case is when your work history is too long to fit on a single page. Here's how to handle it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify items to move">
    Review your Experience section and decide which roles should appear on page 1 (typically your most recent and relevant positions) and which can go on page 2.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move older positions">
    For each older position you want to relocate:

    1. Open the item's dropdown menu
    2. Click <Badge>Move to</Badge>
    3. Select **Page 2** (or the appropriate page)

    <Info>
      If no Experience section exists on page 2, a new custom section will be created automatically with the same type, so your formatting stays consistent.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the result">
    Check the resume preview to ensure:

    - Page 1 contains your most important, recent roles
    - Page 2 continues with your earlier experience
    - The section headings and styling remain consistent

    {/* TODO: Add screenshot showing a resume with Experience split across page 1 and page 2 */}
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for organizing multi-page resumes

<Tip>
  **Keep it logical**: Maintain chronological order within each page. Move complete job entries rather than splitting a single role across pages.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use custom section names**: After moving items to a new custom section, you can rename it (e.g., "Earlier Experience" or "Additional Projects") to provide context for recruiters.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Moving items reorganizes your content but doesn't affect the data itself. You can always move items back or to different sections as needed.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see the "Move to" option

Make sure you're clicking the dropdown menu on a **section item** (like an individual job or project), not the section header itself. The Move to feature is only available for items within sections.

### The destination I want isn't listed

The Move to submenu shows destinations compatible with the item type. For example, an Experience item can only be moved to other Experience-type sections. If you need to change an item's type entirely, you may need to recreate it in the desired section.

### My custom section wasn't created

If you're moving to a page that already has a section of the same type, the item will be added to that existing section rather than creating a new one. This is by design to avoid duplicate sections.
