## What are Private Notes?

The **Private Notes** section is a dedicated space for storing personal information about a specific resume. This content is completely private and will never appear on your resume, whether viewed publicly or exported as a PDF.

Think of it as a built-in notebook attached to each resume where you can jot down anything relevant to your job search.

<Info>
  Private Notes are stored securely with your resume data and are only visible to you when editing your resume.

## Where to find it

In the resume builder, open the **right sidebar** and select **Notes** from the available sections.

## Use cases

Private Notes are designed to help you stay organized during your job search. Here are some practical ways to use them:

### Track job applications

Keep a record of where you've sent this particular resume:

- Company names and positions applied for
- Application dates and deadlines
- Recruiter or hiring manager contact information
- Application status (submitted, interviewing, offer, rejected)

### Save job description links

Paste links to the original job postings so you can quickly reference them when preparing for interviews or following up.

<Tip>
  Job postings often get taken down after a position is filled. Consider copying key requirements or responsibilities into your notes as a backup.
</Tip>

### Interview preparation

Store notes to help you prepare:

- Questions you want to ask the interviewer
- Key points to highlight from your experience
- Salary expectations and negotiation notes
- Company research and talking points

### Version control reminders

If you maintain multiple versions of your resume, use notes to remind yourself:

- What makes this version unique
- Which types of roles this resume is tailored for
- What was changed from your base resume

### Follow-up reminders

Track your follow-up schedule:

- When you last followed up with a company
- Next steps and deadlines
- Response notes from recruiters

## How to use it

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Notes section">
    In the resume builder, click on **Notes** in the right sidebar to expand the section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write your notes">
    Use the rich text editor to add your notes. You can format text with bold, italics, bullet points, and more.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notes save automatically">
    Your notes are saved automatically as you type—there's no need to click a save button.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Privacy guarantee

<Warning>
  Private Notes are for your eyes only. They will **never** appear on:
  - Your exported PDF or other file formats
  - Your publicly shared resume link
  - Any printed version of your resume
</Warning>

This makes it safe to store sensitive information like salary expectations, candid thoughts about opportunities, or personal reminders that you wouldn't want an employer to see.

## Tips for effective note-taking

- **Be consistent**: Use a similar format across all your resumes to make it easy to find information
- **Date your entries**: Add dates when noting application submissions or follow-ups
- **Keep it relevant**: Focus on information specific to this resume version and its target roles
- **Update regularly**: Keep your notes current as your job search progresses
