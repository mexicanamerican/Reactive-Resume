When your resume content overflows the page, Reactive Resume displays a warning just below the page. This guide explains how to reorganize and adjust your content so everything fits within your chosen page format.

<Warning>
  While Reactive Resume supports multi-page resumes, each page has a fixed height based on your chosen format (A4 or Letter). If a single page's content exceeds this height, parts of your resume may be rendered improperly when printed or exported.
</Warning>

## Quick fixes

Here are several ways to fit your content within a page, ordered from content changes to layout adjustments.

### 1. Shorten text blocks

Long paragraphs take up space without adding proportional value. Review each section and cut ruthlessly:

- **Use bullet points** instead of paragraphs. Bullets are easier to scan and take less vertical space.
- **Remove filler words.** "Was responsible for managing" becomes "Managed."
- **Focus on impact.** Keep measurable achievements; cut generic descriptions.
- **Limit bullets per entry.** Three to five bullets per job is usually enough.

<Tip>
  Read each bullet point and ask: "Does this help me get an interview?" If not, cut it.
</Tip>

### 2. Use multi-column layouts

Some sections work better in multiple columns, especially lists of short items.

In the left sidebar, find the section you want to adjust, click on the section heading (not an item), and change the **Columns** setting.

Good candidates for multi-column layouts:

| Section | Recommended Columns |
|---------|---------------------|
| Skills | > 2 columns |
| Languages | > 3 columns |
| Interests | > 2 columns |
| Profiles | > 3 columns |
| Certifications (if brief) | > 2 columns |

<Info>
  Multi-column layouts work best for sections with short, uniform items. Sections with long descriptions (like Experience or Projects) usually work better in a single column.
</Info>

### 3. Move items to another page

If you have more content than fits on one page, move less important items to page two. This keeps your first page focused on your most relevant experience.

Use the **Move to** feature to relocate items:

1. Open the item's dropdown menu (three-dot icon)
2. Hover over **Move to**
3. Select the destination page

For detailed instructions, see [Moving items between sections](/guides/moving-items-between-sections).

<Tip>
  Keep your most recent and relevant experience on page one. Move older positions or less critical sections (like older projects or volunteer work) to subsequent pages.
</Tip>

### 4. Adjust layout and design settings

The right sidebar contains settings that control how much space your content uses. Small adjustments here can make a big difference.

Open the right sidebar and explore these options:

| Setting | Where to find it | Effect |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| **Font size** | Typography | Smaller fonts fit more text per line and per page |
| **Line height** | Typography | Tighter line spacing reduces vertical space |
| **Margins** | Page | Smaller margins give you more usable area |
| **Section gaps** | Page | Reducing gaps between sections saves space |
| **Sidebar width** | Layout | Adjusting the sidebar ratio can balance content better |
| **Picture size** | Picture (left sidebar) | A smaller photo leaves more room for text |

<Info>
  **Font size is the most effective setting.** Reducing body font from 11pt to 10.5pt (or even 10pt) can free up significant space while remaining readable. The editor supports 0.1pt increments, so you can fine-tune precisely.
</Info>

### 5. Hide less important sections

If you're still short on space, consider hiding sections that aren't essential for your target role:

- **Interests** — Nice to have, but rarely a deciding factor
- **References** — "Available upon request" is assumed; you don't need to list them
- **Older certifications** — Keep only those relevant to the job
- **Volunteer work** — Include only if it strengthens your application

To hide a section, click on the section heading in the left sidebar and toggle the **Hidden** switch.

## Finding the right balance

Start with content changes (steps 1-3) before adjusting design settings (steps 4-5). The best resumes fit their content naturally rather than forcing everything into a cramped layout.

Try this order:

1. Cut unnecessary text first
2. Reorganize with columns where appropriate
3. Move secondary content to page two if needed
4. Fine-tune font size and spacing last

<Tip>
  Use the live preview to see changes as you make them. Small adjustments add up—reducing font size by 0.5pt combined with slightly smaller margins can recover enough space for several lines of content.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Content still overflows after trying everything

If you've tried all the above and content still overflows:

- **Re-evaluate what's essential.** Every item should earn its place. Cut aggressively.
- **Try a different template.** Some templates are more space-efficient than others.

### The preview looks different from the PDF

The PDF export matches the preview exactly. If they appear different, try:

- Refreshing the page
- Checking that all fonts have loaded
- Ensuring your browser zoom is at 100%

### I made the font too small and now it's hard to read

Resume fonts should stay between 9pt and 12pt for body text. If you've gone below 9pt to fit content, you're trying to include too much. Go back to step 1 and cut more content instead.
