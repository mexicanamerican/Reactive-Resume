description: "Learn about the three page format options in Reactive Resume—A4, Letter, and Free-Form—and choose the best one for your needs."
---

Reactive Resume offers three page format options: **A4**, **Letter**, and **Free-Form**. Each format affects how your resume is rendered and exported as a PDF. This guide explains the differences and helps you choose the right format for your situation.

## Available formats

### A4

A4 is the international standard paper size used in most countries outside North America. When you select A4, your resume pages conform to these dimensions:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Width | 210mm (794px) |
| Height | 297mm (1123px) |

Choose A4 if you're applying to jobs internationally or in regions that use the metric system.

### Letter

Letter is the standard paper size in the United States and Canada. When you select Letter, your resume pages conform to these dimensions:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Width | 216mm (816px) |
| Height | 279mm (1056px) |

Choose Letter if you're applying to jobs in North America.

### Free-Form

Free-Form is a modern format designed for digital-first resumes. Instead of conforming to a physical page size, Free-Form produces a **single continuous page** with no height limit. The width matches A4 (210mm), but the height extends as needed to fit all your content.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Width | 210mm (794px) |
| Height | Unlimited |

<Info>
  With Free-Form, there are no page breaks. Your entire resume renders as one seamless document, regardless of how much content you have.

## Why Free-Form exists

The reality of modern job applications is that **nobody prints resumes anymore**. Your resume is almost always viewed digitally—on a screen, in an applicant tracking system (ATS), or parsed by AI-powered screening tools.

When your resume is processed digitally:

- **ATS parsers** extract text content regardless of page dimensions
- **AI scanners** analyze the full document as a single unit
- **Recruiters** scroll through PDFs on their screens rather than printing them
- **PDF parsing tools** read the entire content regardless of page height

Since physical page constraints no longer matter for most use cases, Free-Form lets you focus on content rather than worrying about fitting everything into arbitrary page limits.

<Tip>
  If you don't plan on printing your resume, Free-Form is often the simplest choice. You never have to worry about content overflowing or awkward page breaks.

## Choosing the right format

Use this quick reference to decide which format fits your needs:

| Situation | Recommended Format |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Applying to jobs in North America | Letter |
| Applying to jobs internationally | A4 |
| Digital-only applications (no printing) | Free-Form |
| Uploading to ATS or job portals | Free-Form |
| Need to print physical copies | A4 or Letter |
| Long resume with lots of content | Free-Form |
| Traditional industries (law, finance) | A4 or Letter |

<Warning>
  If you switch from Free-Form to A4 or Letter, your content will be split across multiple pages. Review the result carefully to ensure page breaks don't occur in awkward places.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does Free-Form work with ATS systems?">
    Yes. ATS systems parse the text content of your PDF, not the page dimensions. Free-Form resumes are fully compatible with applicant tracking systems.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I switch formats after creating my resume?">
    Absolutely. You can change the format at any time from the Page section in the right sidebar. Your content is preserved—only the layout changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if a job posting asks for a 'one-page resume'?">
    If the employer specifically requests a one-page resume and expects a traditional format, use A4 or Letter and ensure your content fits within a single page. See [Fitting content on a page](/guides/fitting-content-on-a-page) for tips.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Free-Form affect the file size?">
    Slightly. A longer single page may produce a marginally larger PDF than a paginated version of the same content, but the difference is negligible for typical resume lengths.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which format should I use for LinkedIn?">
    LinkedIn doesn't display uploaded resumes in their original format—it extracts the content. Free-Form works perfectly for LinkedIn uploads.
