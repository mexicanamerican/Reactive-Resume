<Update label="v5.0.0" description="26th January 2026">
  This has been a major overhaul from the previous version of Reactive Resume. The app has been completely redesigned and rebuilt from scratch, to be more intuitive and user-friendly.

  **Here are some of the key changes from the previous version:**
  - 2 new templates: _Ditgar_ and _Lapras_
  - Authentication via Passkeys
  - New user interface and refreshed design
  - API Access and Reference Documentation
  - AI Integration with OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Ollama
  - A better font selector, with real-time preview of the font
  - More comprehensive documentation, with guides for specific features
  - An improved templates gallery, with clear overview of each template
  - Ability to import resumes from PDF or DOCX (requires AI Integration)
  - Reliable server infrastructure, with improved performance and scalability
  - Ability to move items between sections and pages, for better organization
  - A more powerful CSS Editor, with better autocomplete and syntax highlighting
  - Extended Custom Sections to include a type, for better customization and organization
  - Ability to choose the kind of icons to display for level indicators (stars, circles, custom icons, etc.)
  - Ability to resize how wide/narrow the sidebar should be on the resume, or convert a page to be full width

  There's still a lot more that I'm forgetting, but I'm sure you'll find out soon enough as you explore the new version. I hope you enjoy building your resume now, better than ever.
